DSSM is a machine learning model that makes it easier for you to run your symptoms against existing data and predict what you ail from. Ut can be anything from a common cold to a pandemic diseases such as Corona and the Plague. 
_Why this model?_
There are a few DSSM models already out there but they aren't meant for normal people for daily use. This model makes breakthrough in just that area. You get to input your symptoms after which the model makes a decision as to what disease you might have. Then depending on the test results and the symptoms that are input the model makes a much more informed prediction.

# ðŸ“Œ Back-End Technology

Our team built a neural network using Python libraries such as MLP to classify symptoms into disease classes. We cleaned and preprocessed the data to prepare it for use in the model, then trained our MLP classifier to adjust the weights of the network and minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. In the testing phase, we evaluated the accuracy of our classifier on a separate test dataset and achieved an impressive accuracy score. Our project showcases the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the healthcare industry.
